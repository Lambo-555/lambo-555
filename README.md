## Hello world!
### I'm Malyshev Stanislav
🌐 Web Developer

#### I'm intresting in development some usual and unusual things, make them better, faster, stronger.
I am a person who understands what strengths and weaknesses I have. Education, opinions of other people, fashionable reflection help me to find out. Any problem can be solved when the starting point is known when the forces are calculated.

From time to time I take on a job in which I have to solve problems that I have not previously solved. This is a good motivation and environment for self-development.

I am in favor of people helping to solve each other's tasks that they are not able to do alone. Therefore, I believe that teamwork and division of labor are extremely important in any area. If you need to create something convenient, working, then I will be glad to help you to the best of my ability, especially temporary;)
